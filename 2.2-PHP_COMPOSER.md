# It allows you to declare the libraries your project 
# depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.


# Requirements
	CentOS 7
	cURL
	PHP (including php-cli)


# The installation process of Composer is relatively simple. First, 
# let's get in the good habit of updating our server.
	sudo yum -y updates


# Switch into the temp directory.
	cd /tmp


# Install Composer using cURL
	sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php


# Want to make Composer globally accessible?
	mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer


# checking version
	composer --version
