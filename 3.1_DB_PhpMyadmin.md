# instalando o phpmyadmin
##########################

# we’ll install the EPEL repository:
	rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm


# install
	yum -y update
	yum -y install phpmyadmin


# configure web access. Let’s edit that file:
	vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf
# By default, the configuration for phpMyAdmin only allows access 
# from the server on which it is installed. Find the following 
# sections and change each IP address to the one you found in Step 3, 
# or another IP address that will be connecting to phpMyAdmin remotely:
	Require ip 127.0.0.1
	Allow from 127.0.0.1
	Require ip 127.0.0.1
	Allow from 127.0.0.1
# Then exit and save the file with the command :wq .


# Restart Apache:
	systemctl restart httpd


# Verify that phpMyAdmin is working by visiting 
	http://the_IP_of_your_server/phpmyadmin.
